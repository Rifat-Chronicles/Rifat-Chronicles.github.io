## The Green Trail Experience

Cheesequake State Park offers one of New Jersey's most unique hiking experiences. The **Green Trail** takes you through an incredible variety of ecosystems - all within a single 3.5-mile loop. This is where the pine barrens meet the hardwood forests, creating a biodiversity hotspot right here in Middlesex County.

## The Journey

### Section 1: Into the Pine Barrens

The trail begins near the nature center, immediately plunging you into a **pitch pine forest**. The sandy soil and distinctive scent of pine needles tell you you're in the northern edge of the New Jersey Pine Barrens.

*Dense pine canopy along the first mile*

The path here is relatively flat and sandy, with roots crisscrossing the trail. Early morning is magical - the light filters through the pines creating dramatic shadows on the forest floor.

**What to watch for:**
- Pine cones and needles carpeting the trail
- Sandy soil characteristic of the Pine Barrens
- Various bird species (keep your ears open for woodpeckers)

---

### Section 2: The Transition Zone

About a mile in, something remarkable happens. The ecosystem begins to shift. You'll notice the pines gradually giving way to **hardwood trees** - oaks, maples, and hickories. This transition zone is what makes Cheesequake so special.

The trail becomes slightly more challenging here with some elevation changes. The sandy soil gives way to harder, rockier ground with exposed roots.

### Section 3: The Swamp Boardwalk

The highlight of the Green Trail is undoubtedly the **elevated boardwalk** through the freshwater swamp. This section spans about 0.3 miles and feels like you've been transported to a completely different world.

The boardwalk is well-maintained and offers incredible views of:
- **Sweet gum trees** rising from the water
- **Skunk cabbage** in early spring
- **Cattails** and other wetland plants
- **Frogs and turtles** if you're quiet and patient

**Pro tip:** Bring a camera or smartphone. The reflections in the still water create amazing photo opportunities, especially on calm days.

### Section 4: The Hook's Creek Overlook

After the swamp, the trail climbs to an overlook above **Hook's Creek**. This is a perfect spot to take a break and enjoy the view.

From here, you can see the tidal creek winding through the marsh. During high tide, the creek fills up; at low tide, you'll see mudflats where wading birds hunt for food.

### Section 5: The Return Loop

The final section loops back through mixed forest. The terrain here is rolling, with a few short but steep climbs. The trail can be muddy after rain, so good hiking boots are recommended.

- **White-tailed deer** (spotted two near the swamp)
- **Red-tailed hawk** circling overhead
- **Various songbirds** including cardinals and blue jays
- **Turtles** sunning themselves near the creek
- **Chipmunks** darting across the trail
