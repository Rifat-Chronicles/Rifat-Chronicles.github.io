## About Me

I'm Rifat, a PhD student at Rutgers University's WINLAB, where I research wireless communications and signal processing. 

When I'm not diving deep into high-frequency signals, you can find me exploring high-altitude trails and documenting my adventures around the world.

### Research Interests
- Wireless Communications
- Signal Processing
- Network Optimization

### Outside the Lab
Beyond research, I'm passionate about:
- Hiking and outdoor exploration
- Photography
- Travel and cultural experiences
